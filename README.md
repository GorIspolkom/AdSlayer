Small cliker project on Unity3d

The first trial project in gamedev was decided to implement a clicker
for Android devices.
The implementation of the clicker took six months, due to university admission and lack of time for
development, fixing multiple bugs and attempts to apply theoretical knowledge to create
good code. The clicker differs from many other representatives of the genre by the pack system, that is, you can easily
add new levels, new currencies, purchases. There is also an advertising editor in the clinker,
which allows the user to create the content for the packs himself, if the proposed
the developers are not satisfied with the option.
